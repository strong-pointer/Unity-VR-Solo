# Unity-VR-Solo
My semester-long Unity OpenXR VR personal project the demos some of the large functionality and immersion that can be experienced within VR

This is designed to be more of a tech demo of sorts, to show what I have learned throughout the semester.
I have only included build files, which are optimized for Oculus Quest headsets using the Link Cable, alongside my custom C# scripts I had written.
Comfort and interactibility for the users were large priorities when designing.
