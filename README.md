The repository with the code is a compilation of all of the C# scripts I created for this project. For the actual executables, they are here at the **link below.**
</br></br>This project is designed to be more of a tech demo of sorts, to show what I have learned throughout the semester.

I have only included some build files (below), which are optimized for Oculus Quest headsets using the Link Cable OR as a standalone program, alongside my custom C# scripts I had written.
Comfort and interactibility for the users were large priorities when designing.
